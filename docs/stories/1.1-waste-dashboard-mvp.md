# Story 1.1: Waste Dashboard MVP - Core Foundation & Company Directory

## Story Overview
**Epic:** Dashboard Foundation & Core Functionality  
**Story ID:** 1.1  
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)  
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days  
**Dependencies:** None (Foundation story)

## User Story
**As a** business development manager at a waste management company  
**I want** to view a searchable directory of companies with their waste management metrics  
**So that** I can identify potential leads and navigate to detailed company analytics

## Business Context
This is the foundational MVP story that establishes the core dashboard infrastructure and implements the primary user journey: discovering companies in a directory and accessing their detailed analytics. This story delivers immediate business value by making the 5,732-record dataset accessible and searchable.

## Technical Context
- Implements Next.js 14+ application with TypeScript
- Establishes Supabase connection and data fetching patterns
- Creates the main company directory with search/sort functionality
- Sets up basic company detail page structure
- Uses shadcn/ui components for consistent UI

## Implementation Tasks

### Setup & Infrastructure
- [x] Initialize Next.js 14+ project with TypeScript configuration
- [x] Install and configure required dependencies:
  - [x] @supabase/supabase-js for backend connectivity
  - [x] shadcn/ui components (Table, Card, Input, Button)
  - [x] Tailwind CSS for styling
  - [x] React hooks for state management
- [x] Set up environment configuration (.env.local template)
- [x] Configure Supabase client with connection validation
- [x] Create project structure following architecture specification

### Data Layer Implementation
- [x] Create TypeScript interfaces for data models:
  - [x] Company interface (id, company_name, country, sector, industry, etc.)
  - [x] CompanyMetric interface for aggregated metrics
  - [x] WasteStream interface for raw data
- [x] Implement data access layer (src/services/):
  - [x] getAllCompanies() function with Supabase query
  - [x] getCompanyById() function for detail page
  - [x] getCompanyMetrics() with fallback to waste_streams
- [x] Add error handling and loading states for data fetching

### Main Directory Page (/)
- [x] Create main page component with responsive layout
- [x] Implement company data table using shadcn/ui Table component:
  - [x] Company Name (clickable link to detail page)
  - [x] Country
  - [x] Sector  
  - [x] Industry
  - [x] Latest Reporting Year
  - [x] Total Waste (Latest Year)
  - [x] Recovery Rate (Latest Year)
- [x] Add search functionality filtering by company name
- [x] Implement basic sorting for table columns
- [x] Add loading spinner and error states
- [x] Ensure responsive design for desktop/tablet

### Company Detail Page (/company/[id])
- [x] Create dynamic route for company detail page
- [x] Implement company header section:
  - [x] Company name, country, sector display
  - [x] Back to directory navigation
- [x] Create KPI scorecard section with shadcn/ui Cards:
  - [x] Total Waste Generated (latest year)
  - [x] Recovery Rate (latest year) 
  - [x] Waste per Employee (if employee data available)
- [x] Implement data fetching with fallback logic (company_metrics â†’ waste_streams)
- [x] Add loading states and error handling
- [x] Ensure responsive layout

### UI/UX Implementation
- [ ] Apply consistent shadcn/ui theming across all components
- [ ] Implement hover states and interactive feedback
- [ ] Add proper loading skeletons using shadcn/ui components
- [ ] Ensure accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- [ ] Test responsive behavior on desktop and tablet sizes
- [ ] Add navigation between directory and detail pages

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Data Connectivity**: Application successfully connects to Supabase and displays company data
- [ ] **Company Directory**: Main page shows searchable table with all required columns from FR3
- [ ] **Search Functionality**: Users can filter companies by name in real-time
- [ ] **Navigation**: Clicking company name navigates to detail page with correct company ID
- [ ] **Company Detail**: Detail page displays company information and basic KPI cards
- [ ] **Data Accuracy**: KPI calculations use standardized Recovery Rate formula from FR11
- [ ] **Fallback Logic**: System falls back to waste_streams data when company_metrics unavailable

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Performance**: Pages load in under 3 seconds on standard broadband (NFR2)
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Application works properly on desktop and tablet browsers (NFR1)
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful error states with user-friendly messages
- [ ] **Type Safety**: All data operations use proper TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] **Code Quality**: Components follow React best practices and are properly organized

### UI/UX Requirements
- [ ] **Consistent Design**: All components use shadcn/ui library for consistent appearance
- [ ] **Professional Look**: Interface feels trustworthy and data-driven
- [ ] **Intuitive Navigation**: Users can understand core waste trends within 60 seconds
- [ ] **Interactive Feedback**: Clear hover states and loading indicators

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test data fetching functions with mocked Supabase responses
- [ ] Test Recovery Rate calculation logic
- [ ] Test search filtering functionality
- [ ] Test component rendering with various data states

### Integration Tests  
- [ ] Test complete user journey from directory to detail page
- [ ] Test Supabase connection and data retrieval
- [ ] Test error handling with network failures
- [ ] Test responsive behavior across screen sizes

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Verify all 5,732 companies display correctly in directory
- [ ] Test search functionality with various company names
- [ ] Navigate to multiple company detail pages
- [ ] Verify KPI calculations match expected values
- [ ] Test application on different browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)

## Dev Notes

### Technical Considerations
- Use Next.js App Router (not Pages Router) for better performance
- Implement client-side data fetching with React hooks for dynamic dashboard experience
- Pre-aggregate data queries using company_metrics table for performance
- Use Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) for data access control
- Implement proper error boundaries to prevent app crashes

### Performance Optimizations
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement debounced search to reduce API calls
- Consider pagination for large datasets (5,732+ records)
- Use Supabase's built-in caching where possible

### Security Notes
- Store Supabase credentials in environment variables only
- Enable RLS policies in Supabase for read-only public access
- Validate all user inputs before API calls
- Use TypeScript for compile-time safety

### Future Considerations
- Directory page may need pagination as dataset grows
- Consider adding more advanced filtering options
- Chart components will be added in subsequent stories
- Mobile optimization can be enhanced in future iterations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code passes all unit and integration tests
- [ ] Application is deployed to Vercel preview environment
- [ ] Manual testing completed across target browsers/devices
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated with setup instructions
- [ ] Story demo completed with stakeholder approval
