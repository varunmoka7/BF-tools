## 🔍 Key Trend Insights

### Positive Environmental Trends
1. **Waste Recovery Improvements**: Many companies dramatically increased recovery rates
2. **Disposal Reduction**: Several firms nearly eliminated hazardous waste disposal
3. **Circular Economy**: Strong shift from disposal to recovery methods

### Concerning Patterns  
1. **Volatility**: Extreme percentage changes suggest inconsistent reporting or operations
2. **Zero Reporting**: Some companies dropped to zero waste recovery (operational changes?)
3. **Hazardous Spikes**: Large increases in hazardous waste generation need investigation

### Industry Leaders (Consistent Improvement)
- **Lenzing AG**: Massive recovery increase, disposal reduction
- **Mayr-Melnhof Karton**: Strong waste recovery improvements  
- **Beiersdorf AG**: Significant recovery rate increases

### Red Flags (Need Investigation)
- **BioNTech**: Complete elimination of waste recovery
- **Soitec**: Volatile disposal patterns
- **Globant**: Total elimination of hazardous waste reporting

## 📊 Methodology Note
Changes calculated between consecutive reporting periods. Extreme percentages (>1000%) often indicate:
- Changes in reporting methodology
- Operational restructuring  
- Acquisition/divestiture activities
- Improved data collection systems

**Recommendation**: Focus on companies with moderate, consistent improvements (10-200% changes) for genuine sustainability progress indicators.
