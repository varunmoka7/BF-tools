# Project Brief: Waste Intelligence Platform (BF-Tools)

## Executive Summary

The Waste Intelligence Platform (BF-Tools) is a comprehensive waste management and GHG emissions integration platform that provides detailed analytics, company profiling, and sustainability insights for 325+ companies across 7 European countries. The platform combines modern web technologies with extensive waste management data to deliver actionable insights for sustainability professionals, investors, and regulatory bodies.

**Primary Problem**: Lack of centralized, comprehensive waste management intelligence across European companies, making it difficult to track sustainability performance, compliance, and investment opportunities.

**Target Market**: Sustainability professionals, ESG investors, regulatory bodies, and waste management consultants across Europe.

**Key Value Proposition**: Comprehensive waste intelligence platform providing detailed company profiles, waste metrics, performance analytics, and sustainability insights for informed decision-making.
