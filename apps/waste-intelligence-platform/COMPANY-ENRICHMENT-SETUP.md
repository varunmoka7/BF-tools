# ðŸ”Œ Company Enrichment Setup Guide

## âœ… **Implementation Complete!**

Your waste intelligence platform now has **real-time API integration** to fetch unique company overviews instead of generic descriptions.

## ðŸš€ **What's Been Added:**

### **1. Company Enrichment Service** (`/src/lib/company-enrichment.ts`)
- Fetches real company data from multiple APIs
- Falls back gracefully if APIs fail
- Generates professional descriptions

### **2. API Endpoints** (`/src/app/api/companies/[id]/enrich/`)
- `POST` - Enriches company with real data
- `GET` - Checks if company needs enrichment

### **3. Frontend Component** (`/src/components/companies/company-enrichment.tsx`)
- Shows enrichment status
- Triggers enrichment with button click
- Displays data source and last update

### **4. Database Schema** (see `database-migration-company-enrichment.sql`)
- New columns for enriched data
- Audit trail for enrichment activities

## ðŸ”§ **Setup Steps:**

### **Step 1: Database Migration**
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- Copy content from database-migration-company-enrichment.sql
```

### **Step 2: Get API Keys**

**Companies House API (Free, UK companies):**
1. Go to: https://developer.company-information.service.gov.uk/
2. Register for free API key
3. Add to `.env.local`: `COMPANIES_HOUSE_API_KEY=your_key_here`

**OpenCorporates API (Free tier, Global companies):**
1. Go to: https://opencorporates.com/api_accounts/new
2. Sign up for free account
3. Add to `.env.local`: `OPENCORPORATES_API_KEY=your_key_here`

### **Step 3: Test the Integration**
1. Visit any company profile page
2. Look for "Generic description - needs real company data" indicator
3. Click "Get Real Company Info" button
4. Watch as it fetches real company data!

## ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works:**

### **For Black Forest Solutions:**
1. **Immediate Credibility** - Real company descriptions instead of generic text
2. **Professional Reporting** - Authentic data for client presentations
3. **Automatic Updates** - Companies enriched once, cached for 30 days
4. **Multiple Sources** - Falls back if one API fails

### **Data Sources Priority:**
1. **Companies House** (UK companies) - Official government data
2. **OpenCorporates** (Global) - Comprehensive business registry
3. **Fallback** - Professional generated description

### **Example Transformation:**
**Before:** *"Generic company description that looks the same for everyone"*

**After:** *"Acme Manufacturing Ltd is a private limited company specializing in industrial equipment manufacturing. Established in 1987, the company is headquartered in Manchester and operates under UK corporate governance standards."*

2. **Get at least Companies House API key** (free)

4. **Show Black Forest Solutions the difference!**

### **Integration in Company Pages:**
Add this to any company overview section:
```tsx
import CompanyEnrichment from '@/components/companies/company-enrichment'

<CompanyEnrichment
  companyId={company.id}
  currentDescription={company.description}
  onEnrichmentComplete={(newDescription) => {
    // Update the display with new description
  }}
/>
```
